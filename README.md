# Invoice Fraud Detection System

## Overview
The **Invoice Fraud Detection System** is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze invoices for potential fraud. It uses advanced techniques such as OCR (Optical Character Recognition), pattern matching, and risk scoring to identify anomalies in invoices. The system supports multiple formats, including PDFs and images, and provides detailed reports for review.

## Features
- **Invoice Analysis**: Extracts and analyzes key details such as amount, date, supplier, and GST.
- **Risk Scoring**: Assigns a risk score based on various factors like supplier validity, amount patterns, and date anomalies.
- **Trusted Supplier Tracking**: Maintains a database of trusted suppliers and their transaction history.
- **Monthly Reports**: Generates detailed monthly reports summarizing processed invoices and flagged risks.
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: Provides an interactive web interface for uploading and analyzing invoices.

## Project Structure
- `feature3_real.py`: Core logic for invoice processing, fraud detection, and risk analysis.
- `app.py`: Streamlit-based web application for user interaction and visualization.
- `fraud_detection_report.txt`: Example output report generated after processing invoices.
- `supplier_history.db`: SQLite database for storing supplier information and transaction history.
